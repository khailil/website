This website is going to be a portfolio for all of my art. I'm planning on having a featured gallery on the home page and then a full gallery page. I plan on also having a works in progress page so that I can show works that maybe aren't done or I don't plan on finishing.
I don't currently have the about me section written, but I intend to add it once I finish al of my CSS formatting. I'm also looking into a way to make the images load faster.
I'm also going to add a custom header image to the webpages and change the tab icon.
