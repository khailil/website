      <p class="art">
        Here's a short branching narrative story I made for a class project based on the song "Shia Labeouf" by Rob Cantor.
        When I made this story I had one track follow the events of the song, but I also included various different endings and
        multiple routes that could be taken to reach all of the endings. A brief trigger warning, as the song this story is based
        on includes lots of violence, so does this game.
