        Here's a short branching narrative story I made for a class project based on the song "Shia Labeouf" by Rob Cantor.
        When I made this story I had one track follow the events of the song, but I also included various different endings and
        multiple routes that could be taken to reach all of the endings. A brief trigger warning, as the song this story is based
        on includes lots of violence, so does this game.

        This is some of the game art I made for a game jam I participated in with my friends. The main story of the game
        was that you are a time travelling freedom fighter trying to stop the World Oven, the culmination of failed and ignored
        efforts to curb global warming. You have to travel back in time to weaken the World Oven and acquire a stronger clean
        power source to defeat it once you return to the future. Also you have a microwave for a head.
