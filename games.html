      <h1>Chronowave:Global Appliance</h1>
      <p class="art">
        What began as a quick game jam entry with my friends, Chronowave:Global Appliance ended up becoming the basis for 
        my senior capstone project in game design. In the game you play as a time travelling freedom fighter who seeks to defeat the 
        sinsiter WORLD OVEN, global warming incarnite. You also have a microwave for a head.
        <br>
        I served as the art and story lead while my partner focused on the gameplay mechanics and level design, although there 
        was collaboration on all aspects of the project througout. Below is a small sample of some of the art I created for the game 
        as well as a short video demoing a "rough-draft" of the game.

        Here's a short branching narrative story I made for a class project based on the song "Shia Labeouf" by Rob Cantor.
        When I made this story I had one track follow the events of the song, but I also included various different endings and
        multiple routes that could be taken to reach all of the endings. A brief trigger warning, as the song this story is based
        on includes lots of violence, so does this game.
