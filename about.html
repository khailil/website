      <! I'm a mostly self taught artist exporing digital art, fiction writing, and game design. I pretty much only draw characters and
      portraits of people, but I've also done art work for some games I worked on for fun with some friends. My favorite genre  to write
      is realistic fiction with urban fantasy, but I like to try out new things whenever I get the inspiration for it. Aside from working
      on just the art for those hobby games, I also did a lot of the level designing and story work (huge surprise). Oh and I also wrote
      this entire website from scratch, so that's pretty cool I guess.>

        Note: I'm constantly messing with and hopefully improving this website so things may change every once in a while
